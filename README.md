# Read ad-free on Post.news
A simple widget for content websites offering articles on Post ad-free. Links to the website's Post account.
## Install instructions
1. Copy the contents of follow-me.html or read-ad-free into a your website, or a code inserter plugin if you are using WordPress. I use WPCode.
2. Change the @ in the URL to yours. Ensure you don't remove the any of the URL after the / as this will allow Post to see where the clicks are coming from.
3. Save the code and choose on an insertion location. I've currently got it setup to insert before paragraph one on all posts, using WPCode.
